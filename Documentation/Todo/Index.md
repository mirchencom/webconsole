## Plugin Dependencies

[Plugin Dependencies](Notes/Plugin%20Dependencies.md)

* [x] Ruby Gem Solution
* [ ] Node Solution (I think the only ones I need are `coffee` and `node`) 
	* This could either bundle the dependencies or use a solution that doesn't bundle the and fails early with a message "plugin requires X"
	* What do Emacs `REPL`s do? They do not include the dependencies
* [ ] Perform ruby gem test on virtual machine
* [ ] Perform node module test on virtual machine
* [ ] Try running plugin tests again on virtual machine
